#It is an driver to a LEGO NXT printer written in python!

The model of printer is the same of in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNp62EfaJ60  

* you need to create a file with points and vectors, and pass to printer. It will print the file for you.
* You should want to calibrate the pen/pencil pressure and put your own image to draw. You'll need to do it manually in the source code. 
* This code was used in an event of our university and we did rather to create our own driver. 
* The objective was use the svg image vectors to print but we did not have enought time to finish this as we would like. You need to extract the vectors of svg file and simplify it as in all .utf extension files.

the vitorio.tar is an branch that was made to work only with svg files. It was not finished but may work with simple images.
